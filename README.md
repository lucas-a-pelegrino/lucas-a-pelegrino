## Sup!

With around five years of experience with software development, I pride myself on all the achievements I've got throughout all these years. At first, I started as a RoR (Ruby) Developer and went on with it for almost two years. To which I decided to focus on Javascript, using NodeJS and ReactJS as a Full Stack Engineer (backend focused). I'm passionate about writing well structured, highly scalable code, thinking of the best solutions and patterns to keep things organized. I believe this is essential for a project to be successful, combined with great teamwork and management.
