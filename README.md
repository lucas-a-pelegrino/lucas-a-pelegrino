## Sup!

With almost five years of experience with software development, I pride myself on all the achievements Iâ€™ve got throughout all these years. At first, I started as a PHP Developer but migrated to Ruby (Rails) and went on with Ruby for almost two years, in which I decided to focus on Javascript, using NodeJS and ReactJS as a Full Stack Engineer at ioasys. Mainly focused on the Backend side of things, given that is where I found a passion. I love to structure backend projects and APIs, always working hard to deliver code with the best quality and organization possible, thinking about patterns, coverage, and legibility. I believe this is essential for a product/project to be successful, along with great teamwork and management.

I also have a lot of interest in the DevOps part of software development, so I am currently studying for AWS DevOps and Solutions Architect certifications.

## What am I doing recently?
